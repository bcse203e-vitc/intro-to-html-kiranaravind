    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that focuses on 
        creating machines or software that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence.
         These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, 
         and making decisions. AI can be categorized into narrow AI, which is designed to handle a specific task, 
         and general AI, which aims to replicate human-like cognitive abilities.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI is rapidly transforming various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and 
        transportation. In healthcare, AI algorithms are used for diagnosing diseases, predicting patient outcomes,
         and personalizing treatment plans. While AI offers significant benefits, it also presents challenges, including
          concerns over data privacy, security, and the potential for job displacement in certain industries.</p>
